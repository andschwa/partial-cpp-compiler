* Required tasks
** DONE Output to file
Output from this phase should consist of a file containing
intermediate code instructions. It should contain a .string region for
string constants, a .data region for global variables, and a .code
region for instructions. If the input was foo.c, the output file
should be named foo.ic ("intermediate code").
