* Tasks
** TODO Cleanup lexer includes
** TODO Handle short-circuit booleans
Needs labels generated after each sub-expression plus back patching.
** TODO Handle shortcut assignments (+= etc.)
Will require additional grammar rules

** TODO Support class instance initializers
Like =Class::Class(a, b, c): A(a), B(b), C(c) {...}=
** TODO Refactor type checking
With type promotion supported via (=typeinfo_compatible(a, b)=) rather
than multiple complex comparisons.
** TODO Expand type checking
*** pass by reference
*** ternary operator
** TODO Expand list library
*** TODO =struct list *list_copy=
*** TODO =list_split=
*** TODO =list_sort=
** TODO Use flyweight pattern for repeated strings
** TODO Generate assembly code
** TODO Free copies with ref->delete(ref)
Idea for an arbitrary reference handler. Push copies to a list, which
can destroy itself and its members.
** TODO Parallel buliding
Update Makefile dependencies to support -j4 or use Autotools or Cmake.

** TODO Change 'program' back to 'translation unit'
** TODO Align memory addresses
Not really necessary, just a maybe.
** DONE Respect include guards
I keep track of a list of parsed files and refuse
duplicates. Essentially does the job of include guards without them.
