* Compiler and Translator Design Project
This repository is my work-in-progress for the University of Idaho's
Fall 2014 course [[http://www2.cs.uidaho.edu/~jeffery/courses/445/syllabus.html][CS 445: Compiler and Translator Design]], by
Dr. Clinton Jeffery.

** Assignment #1: A Lexical Analyzer
Per the [[http://www2.cs.uidaho.edu/~jeffery/courses/445/hw1.html][requirements]], my initial goal is to create a lexical analyzer
(using [[http://flex.sourceforge.net/][Flex]]) for the subset of the C++ programming language used in
our CS 120 course, dubbed "120++".
